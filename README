pycksum - A Python implementation of the Unix cksum algorithm

The ``cksum`` algorithm generates a checksum for a stream of data. While cksum is not cryptographically strong, it can be used to validate the integrity of transferred files.

Pycksum includes a pure Python implementation of ``cksum`` as well as an efficient C extension that will automatically be used on platforms that support it.

Installation
============
    $ pip install pycksum

    $ easy_install pycksum

Examples
=====
.. code-block: python

    import pycksum
    pycksum.cksum("Any string")
